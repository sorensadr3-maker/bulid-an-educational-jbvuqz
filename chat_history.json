You want to integrate a multimodal AI feature using Gemini Pro into your existing React Native Expo 54 application. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, keeping in mind the current project structure and technologies:\n\n1.  **Feature Goal:** Implement a multimodal AI feature powered by Gemini Pro, allowing users to interact with the app using both text and images (and potentially video in the future).\n\n2.  **Integration Steps:**\n\n    *   **API Key and Setup:** Obtain a Gemini Pro API key and securely store it (using environment variables).\n    *   **API Calls:** Implement functions to send requests to the Gemini Pro API. This will involve sending text prompts and image data (likely base64 encoded) to the API endpoint.\n    *   **Response Handling:** Process the API response, which will likely be in JSON format, and extract the relevant information to display to the user.\n    *   **UI Integration:** Design a user interface that allows users to input text and upload images. This UI should also display the AI's response.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle API errors, network issues, and invalid user input.\n    *   **Context Management:** Consider how to manage conversation history or context to improve the quality of the AI's responses.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:**\n\n    *   Create a new screen or component for the AI feature (e.g., `app/ai-assistant.tsx`).\n    *   Use `expo-image-picker` to allow users to select images from their device.\n    *   Use `react-native-fs` (if needed) to read image data as base64 strings.\n    *   Implement the API calls using `fetch` or a library like `axios`.\n    *   Display the AI's response using `Text` and `Image` components.\n\n4.  **Supabase Considerations:**\n\n    *   If you want to store conversation history or user interactions with the AI, you can use Supabase to create a database table for this purpose.\n    *   You can also use Supabase storage to store user-uploaded images, if needed.\n\n5.  **Example Scenario:**\n\n    *   A user uploads a picture of a gym machine and asks, \"How do I use this machine correctly?\".\n    *   The app sends the image and the text prompt to the Gemini Pro API.\n    *   Gemini Pro analyzes the image and provides instructions on how to use the machine, including form tips and safety precautions.\n    *   The app displays the AI's response to the user.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-29T20:43:23.963995"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a multimodal AI feature with Gemini Pro for your gym workout app. Let me first search for relevant information about implementing this."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for more information about Supabase Edge Functions:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!

Now I've successfully implemented a multimodal AI feature with Gemini Pro for your gym workout app. Here's what I've created:\n\n## Summary of Implementation\n\n### 1. **Supabase Edge Function** (`gemini-assistant`)\n- Deployed a serverless function that handles both text and image inputs\n- Supports multipart/form-data for image uploads and JSON for text-only requests\n- Integrates with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash API\n- Includes proper CORS headers and error handling\n- Converts images to base64 for API transmission\n\n### 2. **Custom Hook** (`hooks/useGeminiAssistant.ts`)\n- Manages chat state with messages array\n- Handles loading and error states\n- Sends messages with optional images to the Edge Function\n- Provides `sendMessage` and `clearMessages` functions\n- Maintains conversation history with timestamps\n\n### 3. **AI Assistant Screen** (`app/(tabs)/ai-assistant.tsx`)\n- Beautiful chat interface with user and assistant messages\n- Image picker integration (gallery and camera)\n- Shows selected images before sending\n- Auto-scrolls to latest messages\n- Empty state with helpful examples\n- Loading indicator while AI is thinking\n- Error handling with user-friendly messages\n- Clear chat functionality\n\n### 4. **Updated Navigation**\n- Added AI Assistant tab to the bottom navigation\n- Uses sparkles icon to represent AI\n- Available on all platforms (iOS, Android, Web)\n\n### 5. **Enhanced Exercise Detail Screen**\n- Added AI Assistant quick access button in header\n- Included a prompt card encouraging users to ask questions\n- Seamless navigation to AI Assistant\n\n## Key Features\n\n**Multimodal Capabilities:**\n- Text-only questions about exercises, form, techniques\n- Image upload from gallery with questions\n- Camera capture for real-time equipment identification\n- Combined text + image analysis\n\n**User Experience:**\n- Clean, modern chat interface\n- Message bubbles with timestamps\n- Image previews in messages\n- Keyboard-aware layout\n- Loading states and error handling\n- Clear conversation history\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n- \"How do I properly perform a squat?\"\n- \"What muscles does bench press work?\"\n- Upload gym equipment photo: \"How do I use this machine?\"\n- \"What's the difference between Romanian and conventional deadlifts?\"\n- Take a photo of form: \"Is my form correct?\"\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo complete the setup, you need to:\n\n1. **Set the Gemini API Key** in Supabase:\n   ```bash\n   supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n   Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey\n\n2. The feature is now fully integrated and ready to use!\n\nThe AI Assistant will help users with:\n- Exercise form and technique questions\n- Equipment identification and usage\n- Workout programming advice\n- Muscle group targeting\n- Safety and injury prevention tips\n- Personalized exercise modifications\n\nAll interactions are processed securely through your Supabase Edge Function, keeping your API key safe and allowing you to monitor usage."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "9b071db511ae6c2199cb764cccaab536e79631a9", "message": "feat: Implement AI assistant screen and hook with Gemini integration", "timestamp": "2025-10-29T20:50:15Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/ai-assistant.tsx", "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "app/exercise/[id].tsx", "hooks/useGeminiAssistant.ts"], "update_number": 3, "parent_commit_id": "f6a2e8727d91791fdd7e840a355f5347aac01045"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-29T20:42:52Z"}]
